# optiver-realized-volatility

## Setting up an environment

I recommend using Anaconda to manage environments. Create a new environment with

```
conda create -n optiver
```

you should then install python with `conda install python`. After you have done this you can install all the project requirements with

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to add anything needed to run your notebooks to this file.
